Something by August 1st
Done by October, to get ready for Mid Term elections.
Then a press release



Baseball cards of donors on the side.

Card on the side

9 or 10 billionaires.

9 elections

Goal:
"Wait a minute, why is there such a physical distance between billionaires and where they spend money?"

Write up a format for money flow between people and SuperPACs

They have tons of data, going beyond 10 people.

Some of the data is Billionaire -> Candidate, some goes through PAC.
Direct donations are limited by law ($10,000).
501c4 have lots of money (they are opaque).

This report shows that these people are interconnected.

Washington money is more local.
Louisiana gets it from multiple places.

Write a blank spreadsheet with required data.
Louisiana was a concerted effort over years.
